# Seqexp

Seqexp: regular expressions for sequences (and other sequables)!

Seqexp salient features are:

* linear runtime
* lazy-friendly (doesn't consume the whole seq when possible)
* named groups using `as` (in addition to default groups: `:match` and `:rest`)
* greedy (`*`, `+`, `?`, `repeat`) and reluctant quantifiers (`*?`, `+?`, `??`, `repeat?`)
* short and sweet codebase (~200LOC)

## Usage

Add this dependency to your project.

```clj
[net.cgrand/seqexp "0.1.0"]
```

Require it as:

```clj
(ns playground
  (:require [net.cgrand.seqexp :as se]))
```

And have fun:

```clj
;; match as many odd numbers as possible and ends the match with 7
=> (se/exec
     (se/cat (se/* odd?) 7)
     [1 3 3 7 7 9])

{:rest (9), :match (1 3 3 7 7)}
```

(`exec` returns either nil on failure or a map of
   group names to matched sub-sequences. They are two special groups: :match
   and :rest, corresponding to the matched sub sequence and the rest of the
   input sequence.)

Named groups are introduced with `as`:

```clj
=> (se/exec
        (se/cat (se/as :odds-before-7 (se/* odd?)) 7)
        [1 3 3 7 7 9])

{:rest (9), :odds-before-7 (1 3 3 7), :match (1 3 3 7 7)}
```

What about the difference between greedy and reluctant quantifiers?

```clj
; greedy *
=> (se/exec
        (se/* (se/cat (se/as :odds-before-7 (se/* odd?)) 7))
        [1 3 3 7 1 5 5 7])

{:rest (), :odds-before-7 (1 3 3 7 1 5 5), :match (1 3 3 7 1 5 5 7)}

; reluctant *?
=> (se/exec
        (se/* (se/cat (se/as :odds-before-7 (se/*? odd?)) 7))
        [1 3 3 7 1 5 5 7])

{:rest (), :odds-before-7 (1 5 5), :match (1 3 3 7 1 5 5 7)}
```

In the above example we see that in the first case the inner `*` matches as much as possible while in the second case `*?` matches as little as possible.

Greediness affects only submatches and never changes the whole match: flipping a quantifier from greedy to reluctant (or the other way round) is never going to change what is returned under `:match` and `:rest`, it only affects groups.



Now, a more complex example:

```clj
;; match a defn-like body (including name, optional docstring, optional metadata
;; and multiple arities)
=> (def args+body (se/cat vector? (se/* se/_)))

#'playground/args+body

=> (se/exec
     (se/cat
       (se/as :name symbol?)
       (se/? (se/as :docstring string?))
       (se/? (se/as :meta map?))
       (se/|
         (se/as :body args+body)
         (se/as :bodies
           (se/+ (partial se/exec args+body)))))
     '(fn-name "some-doc" {:meta :data}
        ([a] ...)
        ([a b] ...)))

{:rest (), :match (fn-name "some-doc" {:meta :data} ([a] ...) ([a b] ...)),
 :bodies (([a] ...) ([a b] ...)),
 :name (fn-name),
 :docstring ("some-doc"),
 :meta ({:meta :data})}
```

Lazy-friendliness:

```clj
;; proof that the whole infinite seq is not consumed
=> (:match (se/exec (se/* #(< % 10)) (range)))

(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
```

## Implementation details

Seqexp uses a stackless VM with 5 opcodes (`PRED`, `JUMP`, `FORK>`, `FORK<` and `SAVE`), all taking one argument.

The VM is multithreaded (these are not real threads) and all threads are run in lockstep.

The state of a thread consists only of its PC (program counter) and its set of registers (two for each named group). At any time there can't be more than one thread with the same PC.

This approach is used by Pike and Janson in the *sam* editor and is documented [here](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html#ahu74).

### PRED pred-fn
`pred-fn` is a predicate function which gets called on the current element.

If the predicate succeeds, the thread continues to the next instruction. When the predicate fails the thread is terminated.

### JUMP address
Performs a relative jump, `address` is the relative address.

### FORK> address and FORK< address
Forks the current thread in two threads, one thread will continue to the next instruction while the other will performs a relative jump to the specified `address`.

The difference between `FORK>` and `FORK<` is the relative priority of the two resulting threads: `FORK>` gives priority to the continuing thread while `FORK<` gives priority to the jumping thread.

It should be noted that the only effect of this *priority* is submatch selection: when a match is found, its the highest-priority thread amongst the successful thread that gets to pick the submatches (groups). It follows that priority doesn't change the whole match.

### SAVE register-name
Saves the current position to the specified register.

### Example

For example, `(se/cat (se/* odd?) 7)` compiles down to:

```
FORK> 3
PRED  odd?
JUMP  -2
PRED  #(= 7 %)
```
